### Passive elements - they don't need the power supply fo perform their functions such as resistor, capacitor, inductor 

### KVL voltage law - the sum of voltages around any closed loop is zero: 
- make sure you have the consistent direction, + -> -
- - two voltages in parallel should be the same 

### KVL voltage law - the sum of current entering a node equels to the leaving one.: 
- make sure you have the consistent direction, + -> - 
- - two curent in series, both current should be the same 

## Back to AC analysis since knowlegde is getting rusty 
- Voltage is normally as input because most circui operate with a given applied voltage, and the current then depends on the circuit impedence.
