# My_Learning_journey_for_IOTDE

This repository tracks my technical self-study journey to become an embedded systems engineer in the automotive domain (IOTDE), focusing on:

- Git and software development basics
- Fundamentals of electronics 
- Battery Management System (BMS) theory and algorithms
- C programming language
- CAN communication protocols


I plan to document weekly learning logs, source code, and summaries from online courses such as Coursera.
